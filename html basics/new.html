        Mahendra Singh Dhoni born  in 7 July 1981,commonly known as MS Dhoni, is a former Indian cricketer and captain of the Indian national team in limited-overs formats from 2007 to 2017, and in Test cricket from 2008 to 2014. He is also the current captain of Chennai Super Kings in the Indian Premier League. Under his captaincy, India won the 2007 ICC World Twenty20, the 2011 Cricket World Cup, and the 2013 ICC Champions Trophy, the most by any captain. He also led India to victory in the 2010 and 2016 Asia Cup. Additionally, under his leadership, India won the 2010 and 2011 ICC Test Mace and 2013 ICC ODI Championship. Dhoni is a right-handed wicket-keeper batsman known for his calm captaincy and his ability to finish matches in tight situations. Mahi scored 17,266 runs in International Cricket (including 10,000 plus runs in ODI Internationals) and is considered one of the best finishers in the game. He is also one of the greatest wicket-keepers and captains in the history of cricket.

        In Indian domestic cricket he played for Bihar and Jharkhand Cricket team. He is the captain of Chennai Super Kings (CSK) in the Indian Premier League. He captained the side to championships in the 2010, 2011, 2018 and 2021 editions of IPL league. Also under his captaincy Chennai Super Kings (CSK) Won Champions League T20 two times, in 2010 and 2014.
        
        Dhoni made his ODI debut on 23 December 2004, against Bangladesh in Chittagong,[2] and played his first Test a year later against Sri Lanka.[3] He played his first T20I also a year later against South Africa.[4] In 2007, he took over the ODI captaincy from Rahul Dravid and he also selected as T20I captain of India in this year.[5] In 2008, he was selected as Test captain.[6] His captaincy record in Tests format was mixed, successfully leading India to a series win against New Zealand in 2008 and the Border-Gavaskar Trophy (home series in 2010 and 2013) against Australia while losing to Sri Lanka, Australia, England, and South Africa by big margins in away conditions.[7]
        
        He announced his retirement from Tests on 30 December 2014,[8] and stepped down as captain of T20Is and ODIs in 2017. On 15 August 2020, Dhoni retired from all formats of international cricket and continues to play in the IPL.[9][10]
        
        Dhoni received India's highest sports honour, the Major Dhyanchand Khel Ratna Award in 2008 for his outstanding achievements and the Government of India honoured him India's fourth civilian award Padma Shri in 2009 and third civilian award Padma Bhushan in 2018. He is the only cricket captain in the world to win all three of the Cricket World Cup, ICC Men's T20 World Cup and ICC Champions Trophy.
        
        Early life and background
        Dhoni was born in Ranchi, Bihar (now in Jharkhand) and hails from a Hindu Rajput family with roots in Uttarakhand.[11][12] He is the youngest of three children of Pan Singh and Devaki Devi.[13][14][15][16] His paternal village Lwali, is in Jainti Tehsil, Lamgara block of the Almora District of Uttarakhand.[17] His parents moved from Uttarakhand to Ranchi, Jharkhand where his father worked as a pump operator in junior management position in MECON Colony situated in Doranda area in Ranchi.[18] Unlike Dhoni, his uncle and cousins spell their surname as Dhauni.[17][needs copy edit]
        
        Previously Dhoni was the goalkeeper for his DAV Jawahar Vidya Mandir school's football team,[19] but after seeing his goalkeeping skills, coach Keshav Ranjan Banerjee, one who inspired Dhoni to be a cricketer, picked him to play cricket for his school team.[20] His exceptional wicketkeeping skills allowed him to become the regular wicketkeeper at the Commando Cricket Club (1995–1998). Based on his performance at club cricket, he was picked for the 1997/98 season Vinoo Mankad Trophy Under-16 Championship, where he performed well.[16]
        
        From 2001 to 2003, Dhoni worked as a Travelling Ticket Examiner (TTE) at Kharagpur railway station under South Eastern Railway in Midnapore (W), a district in West Bengal.[21][22]

<h1><em>Worldcup Winning moments in 2011</em></h1>
<h3>Remember 2nd April, the World Cup victory and the plot?</h3>
<br>
<h2><strong>

“Dhoni finishes off in style. A magnificent strike into the crowd! India lift the World Cup after 28 years!”</strong></h2>
<p>
    <table>
        <tr><td><img src="https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*fkdn_MPIpquZxHqotpnhFg.jpeg"</td><td>What a fairytale end it was for the crowd to watch with that majestic six from MS Dhoni. Dhoni held his pose as he watched the ball, Yuvraj began to celebrate before the ball had even gone for six and the man they call Captain Cool had sealed his place in history. Sachin’s dream of lifting the world cup came true. The nation celebrated with him.

            One can associate many words with Mahendra Singh Dhoni. ‘Cool’, ‘calm’, ‘tough’, ‘confident’, ‘match-winner’ and so on. But the word that is most appropriate to describe the man would be ‘unconventional’. He was a man who did not play by the rulebook. Whether as a leader, batsman or wicket-keeper, he went about it in his own way. And MSD had made it quite apparent fairly early in his career when he gave Joginder Sharma the last over in the famous World T-20 final against Pakistan. His cricket was, mostly, accompanied by uncertainty and surprise.
            
            India will really miss his calming effect in pressure cooker situations, not just as a leader but as a batsman as well, for he has played some decisive knocks for India coming down the order.
            
            It is really shocking that Dhoni wishes to step down as the captain of the Indian Cricket Team from the ODIs and the T20 formats of the game. This is heart-breaking. While thinking MSD way, Kohli most likely 2019 World Cup captain, so best that he leads in the Champions Trophy so best he starts now. Right thought Captain, but we will miss you!</td>
